<p>AdCharity was developed during a hackathon by teenhacks.hackerearth.com. It was built by Nathan and Talon Pham. </p>
<p>Biography: </p>
<p> - Nathan and Talon are brothers empowered to end poverty. They have seen first hand the terrors of poverty in various places all over the world, including China, Ecuador, and Europe. They want to end poverty globally, but they are first making efforts to end it locally in the United States.</p>
<p> - Nathan has experience with coding in HTML, Python, and C++. He is the one who created this website. Talon decided on the topic/idea of the website.</p>
<p> - Talon has created a slide show for people to look at. The link is: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W4hc1nmIvUSDmsWmcD90PYeDR_7gkFnm0JANc3FDIW8/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a></p>
<p> - Please stay tuned on the youtube channel or weekly updates to see what we're doing!</p>
<p> - Nathan is shown above (fyi). Talon would rather not be disclosed.</p>
<p>Please contact us at backentrancehacker@gmail.com or click the gmail symbol at the top of the page (it should lead to a youtube channel by Talon Pham).</p>
