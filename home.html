<p>Many factors contribute to a person becoming homeless. These include poverty, lack of affordable housing, job loss, lack of health care, mental illness, or domestic violence. </p>
<p>Although the government is trying to end poverty by pouring money into affordable health care and housing, they are acting much too slowly. AdCharity is one of the few organizations that are non-profit and are working to speed up the poverty relief effort.</p>
<p>Important Facts:</p>
<p> - Over half a million people are homeless. On an any night, there are over 600,000 people homeless in the US, according to the US Department of Husing and Urban Development (HUD). Many homeless people spend the night in shelters or transitional housing. However, more than a third live in cars, underbridges, or in the streets.</p>
<p> - One quarter of US homeless people are children. The HUD has estimated tht over 138,000 of the homeless population are children under the age of 18. Thousands of these children are unaccompanied by adults. No Child Left Behind defines homeless children as those sharing housing with other peopp=le due to economic crises, living in cars, parks, bus or train stations, or waiting for foster-care placement. According to this definition, the National Center for Homeless Education reports that local school districts have found over 1 million homeless children attending public schools.</p>
<p> - Thousands of veterans are homeless. Over 50,000 veterans are homeless, according to HUD. Although 60% live in shelters, the rest live unshelters. 5,000 of these veterans are female.</p>
<p> - Domestic violence is the number one cause of homelessness amongst women. According to the National Law Center on Homelessness and Povety (NLCHP), 90% of homeless women are victims of severe physical/sexual abuse (escaping abuse is the cause of homelessness).</p>
<p> - Many people are homeless because they do not have affordable rent. The HUD has had its budget cut by 50% over the past decade, resulting in the loss of 10,000 units of subsidized low-income housing.</p>
<p> - There are less places for poor people to rent than ever before. According to the NLCHP, the US needs at least 7 million more affordable apartments for struggling families. Millions of families spend at least half of their income on rent.</p>
<p> - Over 5 million homes have been lost since 2008, which is one out of every 10 homes with a mortgage. </p>
<p> - The government does not help as much as one might think. There is only enough assistance to help one out of every four low-income families. People who do not recieve help are on waiting lists. </p>
<p> - One in five homeless people suffer untreated, severe, mental illness (according to government studies). Half of this populatin are at risk for further medication addiction and poor physical healt. A University of Pennsylvania study has discovered that investing in comprehensive health support and treatment of physical and mental illnesses is less expensive than shelter and hospital services. </p>
<p> - Cities are making homelessness a crime. The NLCHP has discovered 24% of cities make it a crime to beg in public, 33% make it illegal to stand/loiter in any place, 18% make it a crime to sleep anywhere in public, 43% make it illegal to sleep in your car, and 53% make it illegal to sit/lie down in certain public places.</p>
